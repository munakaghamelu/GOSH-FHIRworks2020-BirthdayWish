# GOSH-FHRworks2020-BirthdayWish
Birthday Wish, a mobile application to help combat potential loneliness in a hospital environment. If someone is terminally ill and may not have family to take care of them, they can use the app to receive and send out nice birthday messages to patient. This can be via an email, or a call to a patient directly. It is to encourage patient communication within the hospital environment, this application may tend towards the elderly – I’m not too sure yet. I will use python, flask, for the backend and python, tkinter, for the front end application.
